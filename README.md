# Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_R
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality globally, highlighting the critical 
need for accurate and efficient diagnostic tools. Early detection can significantly improve 
patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and treatment. Developing a reliable 
predictive model can streamline healthcare processes, reduce healthcare costs, and 
ultimately save lives. 


The objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model capable of 
predicting whether an individual has heart disease based on their medical attributes. By 
leveraging clinical parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, and various physiological 
measures, the aim is to create a predictive tool that can assist in early detection and 
intervention for heart disease.
